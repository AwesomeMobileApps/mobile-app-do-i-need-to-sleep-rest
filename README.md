# ðŸ§  Do I Need to Sleep/Rest? - Enhanced AI Health Monitor

> **Revolutionary face analysis app with real-time fatigue detection and health monitoring**

## ðŸš€ **Major Enhancements & Features**

### ðŸ”¬ **Advanced AI Face Analysis**
- **Real-time face detection** using TensorFlow.js with 468 facial landmarks
- **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) calculation** for precise blink detection and fatigue assessment
- **Facial landmark analysis** with medical-grade accuracy
- **Head pose estimation** (pitch, yaw, roll) for posture-related fatigue
- **Skin condition analysis** detecting pallor and under-eye darkness
- **Multi-frame video analysis** for enhanced accuracy

### ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive Health Metrics**
- **Fatigue Scoring** (0-100% with weighted algorithm)
- **Eye Strain Monitoring** with progressive indicators
- **Blink Rate Analysis** (normal: 15-20 blinks/minute)
- **Facial Tension Assessment** across forehead, jaw, and mouth
- **Drowsiness Indicators** (heavy eyelids, slow blinks, head dropping)
- **Trend Analysis** tracking patterns over time

### ðŸŽ¯ **Smart AI Recommendations**
- **Contextual suggestions** based on real-time analysis
- **Critical fatigue alerts** for immediate attention (>85% fatigue)
- **Progressive recommendations** from eye breaks to power naps
- **Posture improvement** guidance for workspace ergonomics

## How It Works

1. **Quick Analysis**: Record a brief video or enable live monitoring
2. **AI Processing**: Advanced facial analysis using 468 landmark points
3. **Health Assessment**: Comprehensive fatigue and wellness scoring
4. **Smart Recommendations**: Personalized suggestions based on your state
5. **Trend Tracking**: Monitor your energy patterns over time
