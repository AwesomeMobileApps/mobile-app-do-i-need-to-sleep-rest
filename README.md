# DO I NEED TO REST?

**Do I Need To Rest** is a React Native Expo app that analyzes your face to determine if you need rest, a nap, or sleep.

## How It Works

1. The app guides you to record a brief video of your face
2. AI analyzes your facial features, including eyes, skin, and expressions

5. Your results are saved so you can track your energy levels over time
